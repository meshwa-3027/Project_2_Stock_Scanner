INTRODUCTION

This project is a Python script that fetches real-time stock market data from the Alice Blue trading platform and displays it in an Excel sheet. The script establishes a WebSocket connection with the Alice Blue platform, subscribes to a list of stocks, and continuously updates an Excel sheet with the latest market data for those stocks.
